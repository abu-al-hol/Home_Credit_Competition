About: My collegiate attempt at the Home Credit Kaggle Competition...

## Introduction

I am currently a candidate for the Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) within the Eccles School of Business at the University of Utah. If you are a college graduate in need of a boost to your career or want to "exponentiate" your data acumen and business background, it's the place to be. Click for more information...

As part of our graduation requirements, MSBA candidates conduct a final capstone project to be presented at the end of the fourth semester where a local (Salt Lake City, Utah) company asks students to use newly acquired machine learning & data science skills to solve a unique data-driven business problem. In preparation for the final capstone, in the third semester, MSBA candidates have to wrestle with and tackle the "Home Credit" Kaggle competition. Needless to say, its a beast of a project. Specific details, to include a download of the data used in this exercise, can be accessed from the competition itself: 

- [KAGGLE: Home Credit Default Risk](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk)

The data that I used in the above R-Markdown files can be taken from the Kaggle website and you are able to see how I conducted EDA, Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering, and then employed an Extreme Gradient Boosted (XGBoost) algorithm to make predictions about those who would default on loans provided by Home Credit. 

## Project Pages

I included the following html output pages (knitted R markdown files) that correspond to the original .RMD source files here in this repository. You may view the HTML output simply by viewing the following links:

- [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](https://abu-al-hol.github.io/Home_Credit_Competition/EDA.html)
- [Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering](https://abu-al-hol.github.io/Home_Credit_Competition/cleaning-and-engineering.html)
- [Modeling with XGBoost](https://abu-al-hol.github.io/Home_Credit_Competition/Jakes-XGBOOST.html)

A note about usage and licensing. The data belongs to Home Credit and provided by Kaggle. The code above was generate by me, as a second attempt at a Kaggle competition before I joined up with my team to build the ultimate model. This is my best attempt, after hours of wrestling and feeling overwhelmed, to create predictions on the Kaggle provided test set for submission. You may use and download my R RMD markdown documents as much as you like, with proper attribution as necessary. However, the learning curve with this was steep and long, and I recommend that if you are a student and aspiring data scientist that you tackle the assignment with the skills you have and avoid drawing on the work of others. The lessons learned after completing the competition were profound. Do not miss this critical learning by using my work as your submission...there's no point in doing so.
