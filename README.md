About: My collegiate attempt at the Home Credit Kaggle Competition...

## Introduction

I am currently a candidate for the Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) within the Eccles School of Business at the University of Utah. If you are a college graduate in need of a boost to your career or want to "exponentiate" your data acumen and business background, it's the place to be. Click for more information...

As part of our graduation requirements, MSBA candidates conduct a final capstone project to be presented at the end of the fourth semester where a local (Salt Lake City, Utah) company asks students to use newly acquired machine learning & data science skills to solve a unique data-driven business problem. In preparation for the final capstone, in the third semester, MSBA candidates have to wrestle with and tackle the "Home Credit" Kaggle competition. Needless to say, its a beast of a project. Specific details, to include a download of the data used in this exercise, can be accessed from the competition itself:

The data that I used in the above R-Markdown files can be taken from the Kaggle website and you are able to see how I conducted EDA, Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering, and then employed an Extreme Gradient Boosted (XGBoost) algorithm to make predictions about those who would default on loans provided by Home Credit.
